## Notes for improvement (aka stuff that I haven't done yet)

We should probably add a link whenever we tell the user/visitor to do something, such as sign up to be a host.

At the risk of getting political, we should probably condemn the killing of civillians. We should not take any side in the conflict, but we should provide a background, and note how innocent people, especially children, are being killed to highlight why we are doing what we are doing. I did a little bit of that (IA also did this with TakeShelter with regard to the Sudan Conflict).

The refugee resource page, with translations based on the languages native to the regions affected (Arabic, Hebrew, etc) should be made. This should include links to the UN asylum application, the US asylum application, and other relevant resources. Probably do this in DaVinci and get volunteers to do manual translations later. 

Add more information about open-source and other legal consideration. Proposed paragraph is here:
"Refuge Technology strongly believes in free and open software. However, we abdicate all responsiblity to the developers of any alternative forks. Refuge Technology does not take any responsiblity from any wrongdoing that may occur on alternative sites or versions.  The only implementation that Refuge Technology is responsible for is (insert domain). Make sure you are on this one before submitting any info!"

While we are it, we should also add a footer or note in the form:
"By filling out this form, you consent to sharing your personal details, such as your ID, address, and other relevant information, with a moderator from the Shelter team. You also consent to sharing your details with relevant NGOs and humanatarian organizations in your area. 

We should also consider adding links that go to the main Refuge Technology page and link to the Discord.
