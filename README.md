### Take Refuge

Take Refuge is a humanitarian and non-profit application inspired by Internet Activism’s [Ukraine Take Shelter](https://www.ukrainetakeshelter.com/) application. Our goal is to allow vetted hosts to host refugees or displaced people in their homes all over the world, aiming to alleviate the effects of displacement by conflict, disaster, or other events.

With disasters & conflict across the world increasing the spread of displacement, we strongly believe an actively maintained and funded software solution is necessary to enable people to share their shelter with those in need.

Hosts can host their homes to displaced individuals anywhere, with special attention and consideration given to homes or shelter near areas of conflict, disaster, or displacement events. The Refuge Technology team verify hosts are real people and do not have malicious intentions through a rigorous security verification process.

## Who we are:

Refuge Technology is a non-profit collective of engineers and volunteers passionate about helping fellow humans through technology & software. We plan on building various applications to help alleviate the effects of natural disasters and conflicts across the world. We are not affiliated with any government or political organization and are completely independent, relying on donations to fund our projects. We plan on offering our products and services for free to NGOs and humanitarian organizations as well as all fellow humans in need regardless of race, creed, religion, or political affiliation.

With Take Refuge specifically, we aim to provide NGO's & verified humanitarian groups a database of vetted hosts (hosts that are real people and do not have harmful or malicious intentions) that can house displaced individuals within their homes. We are actively seeking out partnerships with these organizations. If you have connections to any NGOs or are a NGO contact us [here](mailto:refuge_technology@proton.me).

## Host Criteria:

Hosts must first complete an application with the details of their home consisting of:

- Contact information
- A physical address
- Email address
- Country
- ZIP code
- Description of home with images as well as any other relevant information

Next, we verify hosts are real people through either a live interview or video interview where we confirm hosts are real people and do not have malicious intentions by questioning them about their identity, background, and reason for wanting to be a host. We also require an ID verification step to confirm identity - facilitated by Stripe using their Identity solution.

Finally, after a final internal review, the host information is added to our database to be accessed by NGOs and other humanitarian organizations. These NGOs & humanitarian workers can then filter through our database of hosts to find a host that is suitable for the displaced person they are trying to find shelter for.

## Goals:

Our current goal is to partner with NGO’s and organizations across the world and provide them with our database of vetted hosts to match with their registered refugees/displaced people. We hope that by our partnership we can work together on a shared goal of reducing the effects of displacement in the world.

Prospective hosts' generosity in providing shelter to displaced people is absolutely essential to achieving that goal and we aim to partner with as many official organizations as possible to accomplish this. Our first and utmost priority is protecting the security, safety, and property of both our hosts and the displaced people using our application.

We are also looking for those with influence or audience to help us spread the word about our application. If you have a large relevant audience and would like to help us spread the word about our application, please share us on social media or contact us for possible partnerships.
